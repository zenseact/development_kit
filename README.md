# Zenseact Open Dataset Overview
Zenseact Open dataset is a multimodal dataset consisting of 6666
unique sequences, captured by Zenseactsâ€™ development vehicles in real-world traffic scenarios on highway,
country, and urban roads in and around Warsaw, Poland. The data were collected during the day and night under varying weather conditions.
Each sequence is composed of sensor data from LiDAR, camera, high-precision GPS and the vehicle bus, in addition to exhaustive annotations for several autonomous driving tasks.
